## Thomas Strothjohann

I am a digital journalist and web developer. I have reported on serious topics like a [transport of relief goods to the Syrian border](http://williwillhelfen.de). But I also told stories about people brewing beer, finding dogs or riding bikes. With my new web development skills I would like to contribute to innovative journalistic projects.

## Skills

#### Reporting
Almost three years of working as an editor for [Oberhessische Presse](http://op-marburg.de)

- I was responsible for growing their social media audience, developing digital projects and producing a daily page of the paper starring local reportages.
- I have won two journalism awards for online journalism projects in the past three years [Ernst-Schneider-Preis 2012](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst-Schneider-Preis#2012) and [Deutscher Lokaljournalistenpreis 2014]( http://www.op-marburg.de/Lokales/Marburg/Deutscher-Lokaljournalistenpreis-fuer-die-OP))
- A collection of journalistic work I have done in the past you can find in my [torial portfolio](https://www.torial.com/thomas.strothjohann). 

#### Tech in Journalism

I specialize in technology in journalism.

- I have been writing for [medium magazin](http://www.mediummagazin.de), a professional journal for journalists.
- I reported on content management systems, web documentaries, news apps and technology in journalism in general. I also explained new tools to other journalists in a monthly column.
- I recently wrote a [special about the New York Times Innovation Report](http://cf.newsroom.de/shop/index.cfm?step=1&kategorie=wkst).

## Education

### Makers Academy (Feb 2015 - May 2015)

I've quit my job as an editor in February 2015 to explore where digital journalism and online storytelling are heading. My first step in doing so was learning how to code at Makers Academy in London.

####In 12 weeks from 0 to quite a lot (...I would say):

During my time at Makers I haven't done anything but to code. We started with Ruby, Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming. We went on with Sinatra-based web apps like this little [Twitter clone](https://github.com/TStrothjohann/chitter). Thereafter I learned JavaScript and AngularJS, and build a [blog aggregator](https://github.com/TStrothjohann/blogbook-1) on a slim node-server. My final project was a Rails-based [social network for hobby chefs called Dinnr](http://codereporter.de/?p=149).

- Of all those technologies I have developed a particular interest in RESTful APIs. I have learned how to serve them, test them and experimented with different ways of using content from several APIs.

- TDD has guided me through this process: RSpec, Capybara and Cucumber in Ruby projects, Jasmine and Protractor for testing JS and Angular.

- I've been [blogging about my dive into code](http://www.codereporter.de)

### University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt (2008/10 - 2012/03)

- Online Journalism, Diplom
- Grade: 1,2
- Thesis: A [web documentary](http://www.bergdreh.de) about a film team trying to climb the Mont Blanc.

### Working in multilingual teams

- I have worked in a variety of different teams: in agile environments and traditionally managed teams, in German, English and Spanish.
